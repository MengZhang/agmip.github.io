# The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project



The AgMIP Mission is to significantly improve agricultural models, and scientific and technological capabilities, for assessing impacts of climate variability and change and other driving forces on agriculture, food security, and poverty at local to global scales. 

Please visit [AgMIP.org](https://agmip.org/) for more information on the activities of the many AgMIP teams.

The purpose of this website is to document the data interoperability tools developed by and for AgMIP researchers.
